Episode 1 (Installation and Intro)

    Go to the official website for help

    Command is "pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117"

    I can't use Cuda since I don't have an Nvidia GPU



Episode 2 (Tensor Basics)

    In pytorch everything is based on Tensor Operations, Can be n-dimensional

    torch.empty(x,y,...) will make a Tensor with any number of dimensions where x and y are the size of each dimension.

    torch.empty(2,2) is a 2 by 2 Tensor

    dtype can be used to specify the variable type used in the Tensor (torch.empty(x,y, dtype=torch.float16))

    Tensors can be made from lists just like how you'd expect it to work
     
    Operations  

        Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

        Slicing works similarly to arrays with colons and such

        Reshaping with the view method. The values must fit unless if you start with a -1. Then pytorch will do it for you.

        Converting from a numpy tensor to a pytorch one
        
            the numpy() method converts from tensor to a numpy array

            from_numpy() method converts from numpy array to a tensor

            
    
    EVERY FUNCTION THAT HAS A TRAILING _ WILL BE AN IN PLACE OPERATION.
